# quotes

## Lab08

This app shows random popular book quotes with the author name,
It chooses one quote each time it is run.
And I used GSON to parse the .json file. 

## Lab09
Rather than using a hardcoded file of JSON data with quotes as in Lab08,
the quotes will be grabbed from an API and display those to the user.
